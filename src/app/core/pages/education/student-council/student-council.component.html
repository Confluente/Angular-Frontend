    <h1>Student Council</h1>
    <h2>Honors Bachelor Program</h2>
    <p>The Student Council consists of students from every track. Together, they will represent the interests of honors
        students in meetings with the Honors Academy. By being up to date about the progress in their tracks, they can help
        evaluate the quality of the Honors projects to safeguard excellence.</p>
    <h3>Purpose of the Student Council</h3>
    <p>The Student Council is there to improve your Honors experiences within the track. The main
        goal of the council is to provide ideas and feedback to the Honors Academy with which
        Honors Academy can optimize the Honors Bachelor program.</p>
    <h3>Responsibilities Student Council member</h3>
    <p>Being a member of the Student Council includes the following responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide ideas and feedback to the Honors Academy</li>
        <li>To act as a representative for all students in a track (not only the members' own personal opinions and issues)</li>
        <li>To make sure that the appropriate escalation ladder is followed before discussing
            something in the Student Council meeting. Problems in a track should first be
            discussed with the students' coach. If that is not possible or does not work, then it
            should be discussed with the track coordinator. If that is also not possible or does not
            work, then the Honors Academy can be contacted, and the problem can be raised in
            the Student Council. Of course, track ascending problems or ideas can be put forward
            directly in the Student Council.

    <h2>Honors Master Program</h2>
    <p>The Honors Master Program also has a Student Council, which functions separately from the Student Council for the Bachelor Program.
        The Student Council for the Master Program convenes twice per academic year, once in Q2 and once in Q4, whenever feasible, with students from both cohorts attending the sessions.
        The agenda is collaboratively determined by the students and the staff. Although the Student Council operates as an informal body, it plays a crucial role in providing advisory input to the Dean of the Honors Academy on matters such as regulations, evaluations, and more. 
        While the council does not possess formal decision-making authority, its recommendations hold significant weight in shaping the direction of the Honors Academy.
