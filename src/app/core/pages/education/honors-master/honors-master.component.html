        Honors for Master students
    </h1>
    <p>The Graduate School has developed an exciting honors program for curious, talented, and 
        open-minded Master students. This program is open for all master's students who are 
        interested in exploring and developing personal leadership skills, to deepen your 
        understanding of how you can make most of your talents, create value for yourself and 
        others and what skills you need to apply for those talents successfully in practice.</p>
    <p>You can opt for a focus on ‘leadership in science’, ‘leadership in society’ or ‘leadership in industry’.
        Within this focus you can put a personal emphasis, for example on research, design, entrepreneurship, teaching,
        management or a combination that you prefer.</p>
    <p>Regardless of your chosen focus and emphasis this program will give you the opportunity to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>define and achieve your own ambitious challenges (personal leadership)</li>
        <li>build your own program suited to your own interests and needs</li>
        <li>prepare yourself for scientific, societal and/or industrial leadership</li>
        <li>focus on the outside world in terms of contents and people</li>
        <li>give yourself a head start for your future career and job opportunities</li>
    </ul>
